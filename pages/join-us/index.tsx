// This code defines a React functional component named JoinUs that displays a message for users who are interested in joining the website's team but there are no current vacancies.

// The component uses the Text, Anchor, and Box components from the @mantine/core library to render text and links.

// The main message is displayed in a large font size (48px) and bold weight (700) to emphasize that there are no vacancies at the moment.

// Below the main message, there is a smaller message that thanks the user for their interest and encourages them to check back later for future opportunities. The message also provides a link to the website's contact page if the user has any general queries or suggestions.

// Finally, the component is exported as a default export.

import { Text, Anchor, Box } from '@mantine/core';

export default function JoinUs() {
  return (
    <Box>
      <Text fz={48} fw={700} align="center">
        We are full right now :(
